# Computer Graphics CC6112

I'm currently having Computer Graphics classes. 

It's a hands-on class that demands huge effort from students to accomplish challenges in order to get evaluated.

All the code is written in C++ using the OpenGL library.

# Tasks

1. Geometric Transformation (Translate and Rotate)

2. Curves and Surfaces (Bezier, Hermite and BSplines)
